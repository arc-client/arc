/**
 * A class extending the [AbstractContext] in the [MinecraftClient].
 * This is considered the "safe" variant of the contexts as the properties are non-`null`.
 * Methods in this context will not need to perform `null` checks for type safety.
 *
 * The [SafeContext] is used as a receiver in extension functions to bring the type-safe properties into scope.
 * This allows methods to operate on the [MinecraftClient] without the need for type checks on the properties.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * fun SafeContext.exampleFunction() {
 *     // Here, we can directly access the properties without null checks
 *     val playerName = player.name.asString()
 *     val worldName = world.registryKey.value.path
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property world The world in which the player is currently located.
 * @property player The player entity.
 * @property interaction The interaction manager for the player.
 * @property connection The network handler for the player.
