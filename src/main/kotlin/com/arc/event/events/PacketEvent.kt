/**
 * An abstract class representing a [PacketEvent] in the [EventFlow].
 *
 * A [PacketEvent] is a type of [Event] that is triggered when a packet is sent or received.
 * It has two sealed subclasses: [Send] and [Receive],
 * which are triggered when a packet is sent and received, respectively.
 *
 * Each subclass has two further subclasses: `Pre` and `Post`,
 * which are triggered before and after the packet is sent or received.
 *
 * The [PacketEvent] class is designed to be extended by any class that needs to react to packet events.
 *
 * @see Send
 * @see Receive
