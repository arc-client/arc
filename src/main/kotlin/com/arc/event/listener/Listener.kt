/**
 * An abstract class representing a [Listener] in the [Event] system ([EventFlow]).
 *
 * A [Listener] is an entity that reacts to specific [Event]s happening within the system.
 * It has a [priority], an [owner],
 * and a flag indicating whether it should always listen to [Event]s,
 * even when the Object listening is [Muteable.isMuted] (e.g.: If it is a [Module] and not [Module.isEnabled]).
 *
 * The [Listener] class is not directly used to create listeners.
 * Instead, it serves as a base for the [SafeListener] and [UnsafeListener] classes,
 * which will trigger in different contexts (see [SafeListener] and [UnsafeListener]).
 *
 * The extending class needs to implement the [execute] method,
 * which defines the actions to be taken when the [Event] occurs.
 *
 * [Listener]s can be sorted based on their [priority],
 * if two [Listener]s have the same [priority], their order is determined by their [hashCode].
 *
 * @property priority The priority of the [Listener]. [Listener]s with higher [priority] are executed first.
 * @property owner The owner of the [Listener]. This is typically the object that created the [Listener].
 * @property alwaysListen If true, the [Listener] will always be triggered, even if the [owner] is [Muteable.isMuted].
