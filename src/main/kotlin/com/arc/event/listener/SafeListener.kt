/**
 * A [SafeListener] is a specialized type of [Listener] that operates within a [SafeContext].
 *
 * A [SafeListener] reacts to specific [Event]s happening within the system.
 * It has a [priority], an [owner], and a flag indicating whether it should [alwaysListen] to [Event]s,
 * even when the Object listening is [Muteable.isMuted].
 *
 * The [SafeListener] class is used to create [Listener]s that execute a given [function] within a [SafeContext].
 * This ensures that the [function] is executed in a context where certain safety conditions are met.
 *
 * The [SafeListener] will keep a reference to the last signal processed by the listener.
 * Allowing use cases where the last signal is needed.
 * ```kotlin
 * val lastPacketReceived by listen<PacketEvent.Receive.Pre>()
 *
 * listen<PacketEvent.Send.Pre> { event ->
 *     println("Last packet received: ${lastPacketReceived?.packet}")
 *     // prints the last packet received
 *     // prints null if no packet was received
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property priority The priority of the listener. Listeners with higher priority are executed first.
 * @property owner The owner of the listener. This is typically the object that created the listener.
 * @property alwaysListen If true, the listener will always be triggered, even if the owner is not enabled.
 * @property function The function to be executed when the event occurs. This function operates within a [SafeContext].
